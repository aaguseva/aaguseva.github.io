I am a research fellow at the Paris Observatory, working in the field of astrophysical fluid dynamics at the intersection of fluid dynamics, mathematics, dynamical systems theory, and data-driven analysis.

I completed my PhD  in 2018 at the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM, Bremen). It was devoted to understanding of angular momentum transport and dynamo action in accretion disks.

In 2018-2020 I worked on the properties of fundamental turbulence in wall-bounded flow, in particular, the influence of forcing on large scales at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM).

Upon that, I was a Marie-Curie Research Fellow at the University of Leeds, UK.

I'm part of the working group <a href='https://dynamos.obspm.fr/'>DYNAMOS</a>,for Fluid Dynamics and Stellar Modelling
